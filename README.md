# Spellcheck the JS

This small script helps Javascript developers spellcheck their strings.

## Installation

Make sure you have Node.js and npm properly set up in your `PATH`. Simply install the `speller` and `uglify-js` libraries from `npm`:

Hit
```
npm install
```
to install all the dependencies

## Usage

Invoke the `spellcheckthejs.js` script as follows:

	node spellcheckthejs.js yourscript.js

The script will print the corrected version of the Javascript source `yourscript.js` to `stdout`.

If you want to, you can provide an extra parameter with the training data for the spellchecker:

	node spellcheckthejs.js yourscript.js data.txt

## To Do

* Cleanup
* Make this a proper module
* Make it installable via `npm`
* Inspect other object types beyond `strings`
